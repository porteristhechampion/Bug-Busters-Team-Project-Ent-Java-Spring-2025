# Meeting Notes 03-25-2025

### Attendance:
- Alison
- Porter
- Jared
- Justin

### Summary:
- First we all introduced each-other and did a little meet and greet
- Jared expertly started the meeting with talking about group expectations and charter ideas
- We came up with the following basic rules:
    - Treat everyone with respect
    - Communicate Openly
    - Give constructive feedback - don't bite someone's head off for mistakes
    - Address conflicts as soon as possible as we all have the common goal of succeeding in this project and class
    - Everyone has an Equal Say
    - Do your part and be aware of deadlines and help when others fall behind
    - If you're going to deliver something late communicate that ahead of time
- We decided on a team name supplied by Porter - Bug-Busters
- We talked about some questions we will have for Paula and what the project might entail and Jared agreed to reach out and ask her
- We thought about if it makes sense to have the team project feed into our independent projects and it doesn't
- We decided that a standalone webservice/application was the type of project we want to do
- There was some discussion on how to best display this webservice once it's created with an API Documentation framework or with a basic front end webapp
- We talked about doing the week 9 exercise on the team repo
- We talked about possibly doing a cat meme generator for the project and Justin agreed to create a problem statement to see what people thought about it
- Alison set up IAM Roles on AWS for each member
- Porter added everyone to the github repo
- We commiserated about debugging pains
- Justin demonstrated a basic project shell and agreed to upload it with the notes for the meeting
