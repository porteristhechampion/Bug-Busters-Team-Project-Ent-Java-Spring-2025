## Cat Meme Generator API

### Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced digital world, humor offers a brief but essential escape. Memes—particularly cat memes—are one of
the most widely consumed forms of internet entertainment. However, there is currently no simple, programmatic way to
request a fresh, randomized cat meme via API. Our project aims to solve this by developing a lightweight RESTful Java
web service that allows clients to upload an image and text and receive an url to a meme in return. This service will provide a fun and
engaging way to demonstrate backend service development using Java and AWS, while practicing file I/O, image
manipulation, and API design.
